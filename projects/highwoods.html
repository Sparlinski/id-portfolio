            <p class="project_p">Highwoods hired our team to design, fabricate, and install a unique ceiling installation for two floors of their corporate headquarters, located in one of the tallest skyscrapers in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina. The installation consisted of over 8,000 lbs of cast acrylic blocks, creating a multi-layered visual structure that leaves a dynamic impression as you walk through the spaces.</p>

            <p class="project_p">Our team visited the design space undergoing renovations. This allowed us to assess the structural features and evaluate the best approach for the design, as well as the most efficient way to execute the installation. Based on this information, drawings were created to capture the details of the space and specifications regarding the cutting and sizing of the chroma material were evaluated.</p>
